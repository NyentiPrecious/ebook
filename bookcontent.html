                    JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight
                    language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the
                    objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
                <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of
                    language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended
                    for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its
                        Document Object Model (DOM). For example,
                        client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an
                        HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input,
                        and page navigation.</li>
                    <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects
                        relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side
                        extensions allow an application to communicate with a database,
                        provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of
                        the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.</li>

                <p>
                    JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different
                    in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have
                    Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows most
                    Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow
                    constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to
                    JavaScript.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by
                    declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small
                    number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values.
                    JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common
                    class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic
                    inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects.
                    JavaScript also supports functions without any special declarative
                    requirements. Functions can be properties of objects, executing as
                    loosely typed methods.
                </p>
                <p>
                    JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not
                    have to declare all variables, classes, and methods. You do not have to
                    be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or protected, and
                    you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and
                    function return types are not explicitly typed.

                To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your
                first "Hello world" JavaScript code:
                <code>function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
                    greetMe("World");
                </code>
                Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your
                browser!

        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="variables">
            <header>Variables</header>
            <p>
                You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The
                names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.
            </p>
            <p>
                A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or
                dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). Because
                JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through
                "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).
            </p>
            <p>
                You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers.
                You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as characters in
                identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and
                _name.

            <article>
                You can declare a variable in three ways:
                <p>
                    With the keyword var. For example, <code>var x = 42.</code> This syntax
                    can be used to declare both local and global variables.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By simply assigning it a value. For example, <code>x = 42.</code> This
                    always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript
                    warning. You shouldn't use this variant.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With the keyword let. For example,<code> let y = 13.</code> This syntax
                    can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See Variable scope
                    below.
                </p>

        <section class="main-section" id="if...else_statement">
            <header>if...else statement</header>
            <article>
                Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is
                true. Use the optional else clause to execute a statement if the condition
                is false. An if statement looks as follows:
                <code>if (condition) { statement_1; } else { statement_2; }</code>
                condition can be any expression that evaluates to true or false. See
                Boolean for an explanation of what evaluates to true and false. If
                condition evaluates to true, statement_1 is executed; otherwise,
                statement_2 is executed. statement_1 and statement_2 can be any statement,
                including further nested if statements.
                <p>
                    You may also compound the statements using else if to have multiple
                    conditions tested in sequence, as follows:
                </p>
                <code>if (condition_1) { statement_1; } else if (condition_2) { statement_2;
                    } else if (condition_n) { statement_n; } else { statement_last; }
                </code>
                In the case of multiple conditions only the first logical condition which
                evaluates to true will be executed. To execute multiple statements, group
                them within a block statement ({ ... }) . In general, it's good practice
                to always use block statements, especially when nesting if statements:
                <code>if (condition) { statement_1_runs_if_condition_is_true;
                    statement_2_runs_if_condition_is_true; } else {
                        statement_3_runs_if_condition_is_false;
                        statement_4_runs_if_condition_is_false; }
                </code>
                It is advisable to not use simple assignments in a conditional expression,
                because the assignment can be confused with equality when glancing over
                the code. For example, do not use the following code:
                <code>if (x = y) { /* statements here */ }</code> If you need to use an
                assignment in a conditional expression, a common practice is to put
                additional parentheses around the assignment. For example:
                <code>if ((x = y)) { /* statements here */ }</code>
